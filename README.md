# E-Commerce Customer Churn Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze customer churn behavior for an e-commerce company. The dashboard provides deep insights into who is churning, why they are churning, and what actions can be taken to improve customer retention.

##  Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric in the e-commerce industry. Reducing churn not only saves the cost of acquiring new customers but also boosts long-term profitability through improved customer lifetime value.

This Power BI dashboard helps decision-makers:
- Monitor churn rate and trends
- Understand key drivers of churn
- Identify high-risk segments
- Strategize customer retention campaigns

---

## Key Objectives

- Quantify customer churn rate across the organization
- Segment users by behavior, demographics, and satisfaction
- Track how factors like tenure, cashback, device usage, and loyalty impact churn
- Deliver easy-to-read strategic recommendations
- Enable data-driven decision-making for reducing churn

##  Data Preparation Workflow

The dataset required extensive preprocessing and cleaning before it could be used in Power BI. The following tools and steps were involved in preparing the final dataset (`cleaned_churn_data.csv`):

### Step 1: Initial Inspection (Jupyter Notebook)
- Loaded the Excel file and reviewed data structure
- Dropped null/unnecessary rows from data dictionary and metadata sheets

### Step 2: Cleaning & Transformation (Python + Pandas)
- Handled missing values in key columns (`Tenure`, `OrderCount`, `CashbackAmount`, etc.)
- Standardized device types and payment mode formats
- Created behavioral flags (e.g., `IsLoyal`, `IsInactive`)
- Derived new RFM-style segmentation metrics

### Step 3: Export (Excel)
- Exported cleaned data to CSV & Excel format for BI tools
- Created pivot tables and charts for early exploration

### Step 4: SQL Integration
- Imported cleaned data into MySQL
- Ran churn-specific queries to explore insights like:
  - Churn by device, city, satisfaction
  - Churn rate trends using `GROUP BY`, `CASE`, `JOIN`, etc.

## DAX Measures & Features

Custom DAX measures were used for:
- Churn rate calculations
- Segmenting cashback buckets
- Grouping loyalty-based churn
- Visual filters and categories

These DAX formulas allowed for dynamic calculations and category-wise insights across visuals.
